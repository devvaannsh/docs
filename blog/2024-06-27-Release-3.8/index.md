June release(3.8) of Phoenix Code is now available for download at
[phcode.io](https://phcode.io).

This month's release is all about `HTML assistance`, `Drag and Drop` and
`ESLint`. We've also addressed numerous feature requests and bug reports, along
with improving app UX and stability.

#### HTML Validation

We have added HTML Validator to help you find errors like duplicate IDs,
unrecognized tags, and more. [Read more here.](https://docs.phcode.dev/docs/Features/Problems%20Panel/html-lint/)

#### Drag and Drop Files and Folders in Desktop Apps - Experimental

Drag files from Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and drop them into Phoenix
Code to open individual files. Drop a folder to open it as a project.

> Note: This feature is currently disabled on Linux due to UI issues in some
> Linux distributions. To enable it, select menu
> `Debug -> Experimental Features -> Drag And Drop Files.`

>  This feature is not yet available in the browser version @ phcode.dev

#### ESLint Support

All new and simplified ESLint experience that displays all ESLint errors in a
file. Fix one or all errors with a single click. To enable, open a project that
uses ESLint in Phoenix Code. [Read more here.](https://docs.phcode.dev/docs/Features/Problems%20Panel/ESLint/)

#### UX Improvements

-   **Non-Intrusive Automatic Updates:** Updates are now installed in the
    background with no more distracting dialogs when an update is available.
-   **Case-Sensitive File Renaming:** Renaming files to a different case, such as
    `a.txt` to `A.TXT`, is now supported.
-   `File > New Project` is now renamed to `Start Project`.
-   Increased stability and app startup experience.
