Some stories refuse to end because of the people who believe in them. Brackets was one such story. Born at Adobe,
it wasn’t just a code editor; it was a vision to bridge the gap between designers and developers on
how we build for the web. But when its creators moved on, the future of Brackets seemed uncertain.

Yet, Brackets lived on. Too many people loved it, relied on it, and believed in its potential. From that
passion, Phoenix Code was born—not as a replacement, but as a continuation of everything Brackets stood for.
Join us as we trace this journey from the birth of Brackets to the rise of Phoenix Code—and discover how a
community’s dedication kept the spirit of Brackets alive.

## Brackets 1.0 - The Beginning
Brackets 1.0 was released 10 years ago at Adobe, on the 4th of November 2014. At the time, Atom from GitHub was
the only peer editor built on the same web-based architecture as Brackets. The web was a very different place then.
Adobe was preparing for a post-Flash world (Read: Thoughts on Flash - an open letter by Steve Jobs, April 2010).
Just a month earlier, in October 2014, HTML5 had become a W3C Recommendation.

Brackets was born as an editor built on web standards, designed for building the web—a window into the future
from Adobe. Adobe was mostly right in this vision. Visual Studio Code (VSCode), built on similar web technologies,
has since risen to dominate the landscape of code editors.

Brackets was created to serve as a bridge between Designer and Developer workflows before the time of Figma and XD.
However, Adobe was primarily about design tools. As a free developer tool, Brackets was never able to find a place
among its design-focused peers.

## Brackets 2.0 - The Brackets Open Source Community is Born

In January 2022, Adobe [transitioned the development of Brackets](https://x.com/brackets/status/1480581149604782080) to the newly formed Brackets Community.
Version 2.0 focused on establishing an independent foothold to continue Brackets' development.

We kick-started the Phoenix Code project as we recognized the need to address nearly three years of
development backlog. This laid the groundwork for the next generation of Brackets.

## Phoenix Code - 3.0, The Next Generation of Brackets

With Phoenix Code, we built the foundation to run Brackets almost anywhere with a web browser. The first web
version launched in June 2023, followed by desktop builds in February 2024.

Version 3.0 was primarily about achieving feature parity and stability with Brackets—and then surpassing it.

## Phoenix Code - 4.0, Present & Future

We start this year(2025) with the [release of Phoenix Code 4.0](https://docs.phcode.dev/blog/release-4.0)- as we reach feature parity with Brackets and exceeds it
in most cases. With this milestone, we return to the original mission of Brackets - to serve as a
bridge between Designer and Developer workflows for the Web. To help *people* get things done simpler and faster.

With immense gratitude for our users' support, we're excited to begin this next chapter of Phoenix Code.
