A decade-long journey of pushing web development forward: The Brackets story continues with Phoenix Code.

## Brackets 1.0 - The Beginning
Brackets 1.0 was released 10 years ago at Adobe, on the 4'th of November 2014. Atom from GitHub was the only
peer editor at the time built based on the same web based architecture as Brackets. The web was a very different
place then. Adobe was preparing for a post Flash world (Read: Thoughts on Flash - open letter by Steve Jobs)
and HTML5 became a W3C Recommendation a month ago then on October 2014.

Brackets was born as an editor built on web standards for building the web - a window into the future from Adobe.
Adobe was mostly right in this vision, as Visual Studio Code (VSCode), built on similar web technologies,
has since risen to dominate the landscape of code editors.

Brackets was created to serve as a bridge between Designer and Developer workflows before the time of Figma and XD.
But, Adobe was primarily about design tools and Brackets as a free developer tool, was never able to find a path
among its design tool peers.

## Brackets 2.0 - The Brackets Open Source Community is Born

On January 2022, Adobe [transitioned the development of Brackets](https://x.com/brackets/status/1480581149604782080) to the
newly formed Brackets Community. Version 2.0 of Brackets was all about finding an independent foothold to
continue the development of Brackets. We kick-started the Phoenix Code project as we figured the need to
address nearly three years of development backlog and lay the groundwork for the next generation of Brackets.

## Phoenix Code - 3.0, The Next Generation of Brackets

With Phoenix Code, we laid the groundwork to run Brackets almost anywhere with a web browser and the first Web version
was launched on June 2023. The desktop builds followed a year later on Feb 2024. Version 3.0 was mostly about attaining
feature parity and stability on par with Brackets, and then exceed it.

## Phoenix Code - 4.0, Present & Future

We start this year with the release of Phoenix Code 4.0, as we reach feature parity with Brackets and exceeds it
in most cases. We have shifted back to build on the original mission of Brackets. To serve as a
bridge between Designer and Developer workflows for the Web. To help *people* get things done simpler and faster.
With immense gratitude for our users' support, we're excited to begin this next chapter of Phoenix Code.
