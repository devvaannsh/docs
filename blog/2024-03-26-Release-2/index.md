## Other Improvements

-   Projects with very large number of files can now be opened.
-   Performance improvement when opening minified CSS/JS files and other formats
    with very long lines.
-   Added support for beautifying SCSS, SASS, LESS, TSX, and JSX files. The
    beautification feature now preserves the cursor position.
-   Improved startup speed and overall app stability.
-   Bug fixes and improvements to new project dialog.
