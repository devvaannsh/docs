May release(3.7) of Phoenix Code is now available for download at
[phcode.io](https://phcode.io).

This month's release is all about Live previews and the little things that make
your work just a bit easier. We've also addressed numerous feature requests and
UX bug reports, along with improving app UX and stability.

#### Live CSS Class and Style Code Hints

Interactively edit CSS styles and classes using the up/down arrow keys in code
hints. This is available in CSS files and inline CSS styles/class names in HTML
files. This provides an instant boost to your HTML and CSS workflows.

#### CSS/HTML Code Hints improvements

Improved relevance of suggestions in CSS and HTML code hints. For E.g.,
typing `b` in a CSS file will prioritize `background-color`. Typing `between`
will bring up relevant CSS property-value combinations like `align-content: space-between;`
(see image below), so you don't have to remember which value is under which CSS property.

#### Move to trash/bin when deleting files

Deleting files from the files panel in desktop apps will move the file/folder to
trash/recycle bin instead of permanently deleting it.

#### UX Improvements

* Deleting the `Phoenix Code` folder in user `Documents` directory is now supported.
* Increased stability and app startup experience.
* `Copy Error Message` button is now available in the problems panel.
